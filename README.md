# RV32I-RISC-V-Processor

The NYU-6463-RV32I processor is a 32-bit architecture that executes a subset of the
open-source RISC-V RV32I instruction set. The RISC-V processor is made of 5 main modules:
Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Register File, Arithmetic Logic Unit, and Data Memory.
There are other supplementary modules used such as adders, 2x1 multiplexers, and a Control
Unit that controls the state of the processor at any given time.
